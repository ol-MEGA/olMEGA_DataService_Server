# todo list for data analysis of IHAB data

## OVD 
1) Feature Extraktor OVD based an Jules ideas (Python ML (scikit-learn) or transplant)


## Feature Analyzer

### Band energy as a new feature file 

Parameters:
* time base: 0.125s or 1s
* freq resolution : octav, third-octave, mel via matrix operation
    form of bands and band cutting (rectangularStrict (no dividing of energy in one band)), rectangularlineardivided, triangle, IEC )

Frequencies from 125 Hz to 8kHz

### Band energy as a new feature
FFT to band is solved
time base 60s 
mean and std of 0.125s blocks 5, 50 median and 95% percentile per frequency band 

Parameters:
* freq resolution

### LEQ (a weighted (?))
a-weighting is solved

### RMS (a-weighted) via PSD
a-weighting as a new databank entry 


### searchable statistics (5% and 95% percentiles)

### psychoacoustical measures

### SoundScape Features
